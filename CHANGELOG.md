# Changelog

All notable changes to EPI Recorder are documented here.

EPI follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and treats version changes as
**corrections to evidence guarantees**, not just feature updates.

---

## [3.0.0] – Planned

> **Status:** Pre-RFC. This is a directional commitment, not a release.

### Intent

v3.0.0 will finalize EPI as a **stable evidence specification**.

#### Planned Changes

- **Removal of legacy patching**
  - `legacy_patching=True` will no longer be supported
  - All evidence capture will be explicit

- **Stabilized evidence specification**
  - Manifest schema frozen
  - Backward-compatibility guarantees for `.epi` files

- **Forward-compatibility primitives**
  - Versioned step schemas
  - Extension mechanism for custom evidence types

- **Trust model refinements** (under consideration)
  - Organization-level key management
  - Multi-party signing
  - Delegation chains

#### Design Philosophy

v3.0.0 is not about features. It is about **guarantees**.

After v3.0.0, the `.epi` format should be:
- readable by any future version
- verifiable without the original tooling
- suitable for long-term archival

## [2.6.0] – 2026-02-20

### 🚀 Framework Integrations, CI Verification & OpenTelemetry Support

This release transforms EPI from a standalone recorder into a **framework-native evidence layer** — integrating with the tools AI engineers already use.

#### Added

**LiteLLM Integration** (`epi_recorder.integrations.litellm`)
- `EPICallback` — callback handler for 100+ LLM providers
- `enable_epi()` / `disable_epi()` — one-line global activation
- Captures request, response, error, and streaming events

**LangChain Callback Handler** (`epi_recorder.integrations.langchain`)
- `EPICallbackHandler` — logs LLM, tool, chain, retriever, and agent events
- Works with LangChain, LangGraph, and any callback-compatible framework
- Graceful fallback when LangChain is not installed

**OpenAI Streaming Support**
- `stream=True` auto-routed to streaming handler in `TracedCompletions`
- Chunks yielded in real-time, assembled response logged after completion
- Usage stats captured from final streaming chunk

**pytest Plugin** (`pytest-epi`)
- `--epi` flag generates signed `.epi` evidence per test
- `--epi-dir` for custom output directory
- End-of-session summary with file listing
- Registered via `pytest11` entry point

**GitHub Action** (`.github/actions/verify-epi/`)
- Composite action for CI/CD pipeline verification
- Scans for `.epi` files, verifies integrity and signatures
- Generates GitHub Step Summary with pass/fail table
- Configurable `fail-on-tampered` and `fail-on-unsigned` inputs

**Global Install/Uninstall** (`epi install --global` / `epi uninstall --global`)
- Injects EPI auto-recording into `sitecustomize.py`
- Idempotent installation (safe to run multiple times)
- Clean removal with `EPI_AUTO_RECORD=0` disable flag
- Respects existing sitecustomize.py content

**OpenTelemetry Exporter** (`epi_recorder.integrations.opentelemetry`)
- `EPISpanExporter` — converts OpenTelemetry spans to signed `.epi` files
- `setup_epi_tracing()` — one-line setup for any OTel-instrumented application
- Trace-level grouping, LLM semantic conventions, batch flushing
- Graceful fallback when OpenTelemetry is not installed

#### Fixed

- **Signature verification**: `verify_signature()` now correctly extracts public key from manifest
- **LangChain handler**: Warns instead of crashing when LangChain is not installed
- **pytest plugin**: Uses `makereport` hookwrapper for correct test outcome capture
- **pytest plugin**: Safe `config.getini()` access with fallback

#### Internal
- 60 end-to-end test assertions, all passing
- Real `.epi` file generation and verification in tests
- Real `sitecustomize.py` round-trip testing

## [2.5.0] – 2026-02-13

### 🚀 Major Features

#### Added

**Anthropic Claude Wrapper**
- `wrap_anthropic()` — proxy wrapper for Anthropic's Claude API
- `TracedAnthropic` — fully wrapped client with automatic evidence capture
- `TracedMessages` — traced `messages.create()` for Claude conversations
- Captures `temperature`, `top_p`, and `system` parameters in evidence logs
- Full request/response logging: messages, tokens, latency, model info
- Mirrors `wrap_openai()` architecture for consistency

**Enhanced Provider Support**
- Anthropic now has first-class wrapper support (not just explicit API)
- Updated supported providers table

#### Fixed

**Critical: Path Resolution Bug**
- Fixed `_resolve_output_path()` double-prepending `epi-recordings/` directory
- Before: `record("epi-recordings/test.epi")` → `epi-recordings/epi-recordings/test.epi` (broken)
- After: `record("epi-recordings/test.epi")` → `epi-recordings/test.epi` (correct)
- Root cause: relative paths containing the recordings directory name were not detected

**Signing & Verification**
- Confirmed Ed25519 signing and verification are fully operational
- Fixed file creation appearing to fail due to path resolution bug above

#### Internal
- Comprehensive signing/verification test suite
- Path resolution test coverage
- Anthropic wrapper test suite (19 tests, 100% pass rate)

## [2.4.0] – 2026-02-12

### 🚀 Major Features

This release adds comprehensive agent development and monitoring capabilities.

#### Added

**Agent Analytics Engine**
- `AgentAnalytics` class for analyzing `.epi` files in batch
- Performance summary: success rates, costs, duration trends
- Error pattern detection and analysis
- Tool usage distribution tracking
- Period comparison (this week vs last week, etc.)
- HTML dashboard generation (`generate_report()`)

**Async/Await Support**
- Async context manager (`async with record()`)
- `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods
- `alog_step()` async logging method
- Non-blocking I/O using `asyncio.run_in_executor()`
- Full backward compatibility with sync mode
- Perfect for LangGraph, AutoGen, and async-first frameworks

**LangGraph Integration**
- `EPICheckpointSaver` class (native checkpoint backend)
- Implements LangGraph's `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface
- Async checkpoint methods: `aput()`, `aget()`, `alist()`

- Automatic capture of all state transitions
- Integration with EPI recording sessions

**Local LLM Support (Ollama)**

## [2.3.0] – 2026-02-06

### ⚠️ Design Correction (Migration Required)

This release clarifies EPI's role as an **evidence system**, not a passive logger.

#### Breaking
- **Implicit monkey-patching disabled by default**
  - Automatic interception of LLM calls is no longer enabled
  - Evidence capture is now **explicit by design**

#### Rationale
Evidence systems must be:
- intentional
- reviewable in code
- stable across SDK versions

Implicit interception was convenient but fragile.  
Explicit capture provides stronger evidentiary guarantees.

#### Added
- **Explicit evidence API**
  - `log_llm_call(response)` — structured capture of LLM responses
  - `log_chat(data)` — simplified, framework-agnostic capture
- **Wrapper clients**
  - `wrap_openai()` — proxy wrapper enabling capture without SDK modification
- **TracedOpenAI**
  - Fully wrapped OpenAI client with automatic evidence capture

#### Deprecated
- `legacy_patching=True`
  - Temporary compatibility flag
  - Will be removed in v3.0.0

---

## [2.2.1] – 2026-02-06

### Changed
- Evidence spec version bumped to 2.2.1
